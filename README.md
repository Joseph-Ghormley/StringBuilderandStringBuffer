# StringBuffer and StringBuilder Example

This is a Java code example that demonstrates the usage of `StringBuffer` and `StringBuilder` classes for manipulating strings.

## Description

The code showcases how to use `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer` to perform various string operations, such as replacement, reversal, appending, inserting, deletion, and substring extraction.

### StringBuilder

The example starts by using the `StringBuilder` class, which provides a mutable sequence of characters. It shows the following operations:

- Replacement: The `replace` method is used to replace a substring of the original string with a new value.
- Reversal: The `reverse` method is used to reverse the characters in the string.
- Appending: The `append` method is used to add a string at the end of the original string.
- Insertion: The `insert` method is used to insert a string at a specified position in the original string.
- Substring Extraction: The `substring` method is used to extract a substring from the original string.
- Trimming Capacity: The `trimToSize` method is used to reduce the capacity of the `StringBuilder` to match its length.
- Deletion: The `delete` method is used to remove a substring from the original string.

### StringBuffer

The example then demonstrates similar operations using the `StringBuffer` class, which is also a mutable sequence of characters. The operations performed include:

- Replacement: The `replace` method is used to replace a substring of the original string with a new value.
- Reversal: The `reverse` method is used to reverse the characters in the string.
- Appending: The `append` method is used to add a string at the end of the original string.
- Insertion: The `insert` method is used to insert a string at a specified position in the original string.
- Substring Extraction: The `substring` method is used to extract a substring from the original string.
- Deletion: The `delete` method is used to remove a substring from the original string.
- Trimming Capacity: The `trimToSize` method is used to reduce the capacity of the `StringBuffer` to match its length.

## Usage

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Copy the code into a Java file (e.g., `StringBufferStringBuilder.java`).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the Java file.
4. Compile the code by executing the following command:

   ```shell
   javac StringBufferStringBuilder.java
